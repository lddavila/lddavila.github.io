# What We Automate

- Document processing (invoices, contracts, forms)
- Customer support (assistants, routing, suggested replies)
- Sales and RevOps (lead enrichment, handoffs, reporting)
- Back-office workflows (AP/AR, HR onboarding, compliance)
- IT service management (ticket triage, runbooks, alerts)
- Marketing ops (content generation, approvals, personalization)

## Approach

1. Discovery: map processes, systems, and ROI opportunities
2. Pilot: build a small, measurable automation with clear KPIs
3. Productionize: harden, integrate, secure, and document
4. Operate: monitor, measure, and iterate for continuous gains

## Outcomes

- 30-70% reduction in manual effort on targeted processes
- Faster cycle times and fewer handoffs
- Higher data quality and consistency
- Auditable, secure, and maintainable workflows

## Technologies

LLMs (OpenAI/Azure), RPA (Power Automate, UiPath), workflow engines (n8n, Make, Airflow), messaging (Kafka), APIs and webhooks, vector search, OCR, and enterprise integrations (Microsoft 365, Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, ServiceNow).

## Safety & Governance

- Human-in-the-loop where required
- Role-based access and data minimization
- Audit logs and fallbacks for reliability
- Privacy and compliance aligned to your policies
