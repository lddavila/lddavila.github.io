# About Me

I’m Luis David Davila. I build AI, data, and automation solutions that turn complex problems into practical tools. I like work that blends research, engineering, and product thinking—designing models and systems, then shipping them so people can rely on them every day.

I’m completing an M.S. in Computational Science at UTEP (Aug 2025) and hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics (May 2023).
