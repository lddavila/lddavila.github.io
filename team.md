# About Me

I’m Luis David Davila. I build AI, data, and automation solutions that turn complex problems into practical tools. I like work that blends research, engineering, and product thinking—designing models and systems, then shipping them so people can rely on them every day.

I’m completing an M.S. in Computational Science at UTEP (Aug 2025) and hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics (May 2023).

## Selected Work

- Spike sorting research: designed and evaluated deep learning models for neuron identification (70–92% accuracy), added parallel processing to speed up an existing algorithm by up to 3900%, and built a new approach that identified ~99% of neurons on simulated recordings.
- Decision‑making models: trained a Wiener process model to simulate mouse decision‑making and created a method to quantify task difficulty, contributing to published results.
- RECORD platform: built a custom desktop app to parse 200k+ experiment trials and a PostgreSQL database for 500+ GB of behavioral data.
- Microsoft Research (intern): used scikit‑learn random forests to predict ALS disease progression from clinical data.

## Publications

- RECORD, a high‑throughput system for uncovering behavioral strategies (Communications Biology, 2024). Featured by NSF.
- A Decision‑Space Model Explains Context‑Specific Decision‑Making (preprint, 2024).
- Spike sorting with dimension‑selection‑based clustering (in preparation).

## Skills

Python, machine learning, data engineering, scientific computing, PostgreSQL, model evaluation, reproducible research, and building real‑world applications and dashboards. Comfortable across the stack from data to deployment.
